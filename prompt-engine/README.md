Sure! Here's a clean, clear README you can use to explain the purpose and workings of your prompt generation pipeline code:

# Prompt Generation Pipeline

This project provides a modular pipeline that transforms raw user input into a clear, specific, and well-crafted prompt optimized for large language models (LLMs) like OpenAIâ€™s GPT.

---

## Overview

LLMs perform best when given clear, detailed prompts. However, user input is often vague, ambiguous, or incomplete. This pipeline addresses that by:

1. **Interpreting the User's Intent**
   Extracting the core task or intent behind a raw user input.

2. **Generating a Base Prompt**
   Creating a clear, direct prompt based on the extracted intent.

3. **Improving the Prompt**
   Polishing the generated prompt to improve clarity, specificity, and effectiveness.

Each step leverages an LLM with tailored instructions to ensure the output is focused and high-quality.

---

## Components

* **IntentInterpreter**
  Takes the initial user input and produces a concise interpretation of the underlying task or intent.

* **PromptGenerator**
  Converts the interpreted intent into a structured prompt suitable for use with LLMs.

* **PromptImprover**
  Enhances the generated prompt by refining wording and structure without adding explanations or commentary.

* **PromptPipeline**
  Orchestrates the above components to produce a final improved prompt from raw user input.

---

## How It Works

* The user provides any raw input or instruction.
* The pipeline extracts the main task or intent clearly.
* A base prompt is generated from that intent.
* The base prompt is further refined for clarity and effectiveness.
* The final improved prompt is returned for use in downstream LLM tasks.

---

## Benefits

* Converts vague or incomplete instructions into clear, actionable prompts.
* Improves prompt quality to maximize LLM performance.
* Modular and extendable design for adding more processing stages or custom logic.
* Easy to use and integrate into larger applications or APIs.

This pipeline serves as a foundation for building advanced prompt engineering tools that help users communicate their needs more effectively to AI models.
